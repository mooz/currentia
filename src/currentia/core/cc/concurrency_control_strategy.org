Strategies of concurrency control schemes

* General Considerations

** How tackle with overlapping windows?

- In the traditional approach, where sliding windows are processed
  with synopsis and eliminates the recalculation of shared tuples
  between windows, results of the window doesn't have reference
  consistency (except for the first result).

- Hence, we decided to trash traditional not to use traditional
  approach every time

- This approach requires the recalculation of input streams, enforcing
  us to keep the part of input streams, which can be trashed in the
  traditional approach, for a while.

* Concurrency Control Schemes

** Optimistic approach

*** Naive approach

*** Efficient approach (with minimal redo-area)

** Pessimistic approach

*** 2-Phase Locking

*** Snapshot
